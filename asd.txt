As a fellowship trained body and breast imager myself at Beaumont, Farmington Hills, I have come to know Rajeev very well during his time here. Due to our department being on the smaller side, with eight full-time staff, I have had near daily interactions with him. During our time together, he has continually impressed me with his observation skills and meticulous attention to detail. He has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to pick up subtle findings that could be overlooked by other residents or even attendings. I recall one case in particular where Rajeev detected an inconspicuous hyperechoic intratesticular mass on an outpatient ultrasound. This was initially missed by the sonographer and seen by Rajeev on only one of many cine clips. We called the patient back for additional imaging which confirmed the mass. in the interim between the two studies the patient was diagnosed with metastatic seminoma, later confirmed to be of testicular origin at orchiectomy. Rajeev is also extremely hardworking and well read. He is thoughtful and chooses his words carefully. Outside of the reading room he is kind, engaging, and well-liked by the staff and his peers. He is a true team player who is consistently mindful of others' needs. From my own experience with him, I have no doubt he will be an exceptional asset to your program. If you have any questions or if I can be of assistance in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely,

Adam Wadzinski to your Body Imaging Fellowship Program without reservation. As a faculty staff member at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center in the Body Imaging section I have had the privilege of working with and getting to know Adam over the past 2 years. I know that he would make a positive addition to your team. He has waived his right to see this letter. Adam is a real pleasure to work with. He is reliable, responsible, mild mannered and courteous. He does not Interrupt, is punctual, and gets the work done. He listens carefully to Instruction, Is a critical thinker, and processes Information quickly. Adam's reports are well thought out and concise, and he has a good eye for subtle findings. In my experience with him, Adam Is functioning at a level nearly one year ahead of his level of training. His thoughtful demeanor and natural leadership skills make him popular with peers and faculty. Each spring our residency program has formal second year resident presentations for scholarly activity. This year Adam chose MRI Enterography: Exam and Findings11 for his formal presentation which was well thought out, Informative, and well received. Perhaps the biggest compliment I can pay Adam, one I reserve for only select residents, Is that I would like to hire him into our group once he finishes his fellowship if we have an opening. Other faculty I have spoken with feel the same way about Adam. In summary, Adam Is an Intelligent, pleasant, and confident resident and will make an outstanding addition to the field of body imaging. I recommend him very highly for your fellowship program. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Sincerely Yours,

Rafay has a very strong background in imaging. Prior to joining our radiology residency, he completed a nuclear medicine residency at Yale and also completed a 2-year fellowship in molecular imaging at University of Pittsburgh. During his residency here, he has been selected as a reviewer for AJR. He also has made 2 oral presentations at the 2017 ASNR conference. In April 2018, he will be representing Geisinger at the ARRS introduction to academic radiology course. I have supervised him extensively on the pediatric and emergency medicine rotation. Rafay has an inquisitive mind, calm demeanor, and a methodical approach to imaging. He listens carefully and takes feedback well. I have allowed him greater independence in dispensing stat reads and performing pediatric fluoroscopic studies as compared to similar peers in his level. On a personal level, he enjoys playing cricket and soccer. I can vouch that he a skilled conversationalist - when not discussing radiology cases, I have enjoyed our conversations outside of medicine. He has an easy-going nature about him that produces positive vibes in the environment around him. In summary, Rafay is a superb resident. He is blossoming into a fine a radiologist, and I have no doubt he will be a valuable asset to your department during his time in fellowship. If you have any question, feel free to contact me at my email gswu@geisinger.edu Sincerely, 
162     Dear Fellowship Director, I am writing this letter of support for Dr. Casey Bishop for a position in your Neuroradiology fellowship. Casey is currently a 3rd year radiology resident in good standing at Boston University Medical Center. I have worked with Casey closely for the past 2.5 years so I feel that I know him very well. During this time, he has been an excellent resident with an impressive work ethic and knowledge base. Casey also has an exceptionally keen eye and is able to pick up on subtle abnormalities while still being able to synthesize an accurate diagnosis based on all the information available. I am equally impressed with him ability to carefully think through challenging cases using all the information to what is usually a strong differential or a diagnosis.

398     Dear Fellowship Director, It is my pleasure to recommend Dr Justin Bauer for admission to your neuroradiology fellowship. I am a faculty at the Department of Neuroradiology at Stanford University and have worked with Justin since he started his residency. Justin is an extremely hardworking, inquisitive, and thorough resident. He is both very earnest and pleasant to work with. It has been a great pleasure to see him grow and develop as a radiologist during his time at Stanford. I wholeheartedly recommend him and think you would enjoy working with him as your neuroradiology fellow. During the times I have worked with Justin over the past three years of his residency, I have been very positively impressed by the attitude and dedication that he brings to his work. Every day, he pushes himself to read more numerous and more complicated studies, keeping himself outside of his comfort zone in order to grow as a physician by dealing with new and challenging problems. He is extremely eager and inquisitive, always asking questions to be sure that he fully understands the imaging he interprets. Even after our readout has been completed, he carefully checks how his reports are edited and works on improving his reports. Through his hard work on the job and continual self-study, Justin has developed an excellent knowledge base both in neuroradiology and general radiology as well. Over his academic career, Justin has performed extensive research regarding diseases of the head and neck. During his time at Stanford, I have been very pleased to act as research mentor on a quality improvement project he designed to analyze the effect of clinical history on resident imaging interpretation. He came up with a meaningful hypothesis and worked independently to seek out resources, collect data, perform statistical analysis, and draw conclusions from the results. Justin is an outstanding resident and I am certain that he will be an outstanding neuroradiology fellow. I know you will enjoy...

474     Dear Program Director, It is my sincere pleasure to write this letter of recommendation in strong support of Dr. Anas Al-Smadi's application for a position in your neurointerventional radiology fellowship program. In my capacity as an IR and ED faculty and also as the chair of the department, I have had the opportunity to work closely with Anas since he began his position as a resident at Wayne State/Detroit Medical Center in Juley 2018. In that time, I have found Anas to be an exceptional resident and colleague. Prior to joining us, Anas has demonstrated a track record of academic excellence in his pre and post-graduation examinations in Jordan, culminated by high scores in USMLE board exams. Anas did a preliminary surgery year at his university hospital in Jordan and then joined neurosurgery residency at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar trying to satisfy his interest in neurointervention. In order to achieve his main ambition of getting radiology training followed by interventional neuroradiology fellowship, Anas joined the interventional neuroradiology department at Northwestern University as post-doctoral research fellow where his productivity is evident from his CV, with the number of papers, oral presentations, and abstracts he has produced focusing on neurovascular research. This background enabled him to hit the ground running when he joined us accomplishing multiple research projects as a first author. Anas conducted a valuable quality improvement project analyzing the adequacy and appropriateness of CT pulmonary angiography studies in our institution. He has also recently submitted a paper assessing the temporal changes and potential value of chest radiograph as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19 pneumonia patients in addition to another small case series in which he presented our experience of mechanical thrombectomy in COVID-19 related stroke. On the clinical side, I have very carefully evaluated Anas's performance and participation in the reading ...

957     It is my pleasure to provide this letter of recommendation for Dr. Shaji Khan as he is con­ sidered for a Musculoskeletal fellowship position in your department He is currently a second year resident at St. Francis Hospital and will graduate in 2019. I have interacted with him on a number of different rotations and I proud to say that he is one of our best residents. I initially met Shaji when he rotated in our department as a third year medical student. He showed dedication to the field of radiology early on as noted by his inquisitiveness, punc­ tuality, and hard work. The quality of the content his presentations were well beyond the expectations of a medical student. We were very lucky to have Shaji return to our de­ partment as a resident, and he has been a wonderful addition. He is always a pleasure to work with on service; he is dependable, conscientious, and very intelligent. It is a rarity that he does not know the details of a disease entity, and if there is something he does not know, he will promptly perform a literature search to find the answer. His dictations are clear, concise, and accurate, and any interactions or phone ca1Is with referring physicians are well documented. One of the real joys of working with Shaji is watching him grow into not just a great diagnostic radiologist, but a very good clinician as well. He can be depended upon to obtain consent for procedures and puts the patient and family members at ease with his sincerity and relaxed demeanor. He is a1so very adept at performing procedures carefully, quickly, and skillfully. Shaji has also become more involved in educational projects. I have bad the pleasure of working with him on one of his projects that is being presented at ARRS 2017. It has been such a joy to see him become more involved in educational activities and research. 1 foresee him being involved in more projects in the future as well. In summary, Dr. Khan is an outstanding radiologist. He will make an excellent fellow ...

I have worked closely with him during his rotations in mammography, in conferences, as weJI as pursuing several academic projects. Rahul is truly one of the most kind and sincere residents with whom I have worked in the past 22 years. He is always pleasant and comes to work each day eager to learn and tackle whatever needs to be done. He has a wonderful way of combining his true passion for learning with an incredible work ethic that is relatively unusual these days. It is clear from his curriculum vitae that he has been both a special and valued student based the number of scholarships he has received. I believe Rahul's interest in breast imaging stems from his desire to feel connected directly to patients. While on the mammography rotation he has demonstrated this by the way he handles all aspects of patient care. More than one patient has commented on how kind, caring, and helpful he was as he explained results and recommendations. Rahul's skills in breast imaging continue to improve as he learns to gather information quickly and integrate it into problem solving with diagnostic mammography. He very carefully learned how to do interventiona1 procedures, always preparing and asking important questions. He has an inquisitive mind which has led him to do several research projects in radiology, including mammography. If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me.

I have known Priyal since she started her residency in 2016. My comments below are based on my own personal observations. Breast Imaging at Cleveland Clinic is a subspecialty practice with radiologists covering multiple sites. We have the opportunity to work closely with the residents when covering Main Campus. Although Priyal has only had one breast imaging rotation, I've had the pleasure of working with her a few, memorable times. She is an engaged learner participating in the reading room and taking diagnostic cases. She carefully reviews each case and makes an assessment. She eager to partake in all cases including ultrasound, MRI, and biopsies. In fact, in order to prepare for her first day on procedures, Priyal honed her ultrasound biopsy skills practicing on a phantom. In addition to her enthusiasm for breast imaging, Priyal has a good bedside manner. She is able to put patients as ease and explain procedures. On a personal level, Priyal is a kind person. The technologists enjoy working with her and she is a pleasure to teach. If Priyal chose to stay at Cleveland Clinic, we would be happy to have her in our fellowship. Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions. Sincerely,
1106    It is my great pleasure to recommend Dr. Priyal Patel for the Breast Imaging Fellowship Program at the University of Chicago. Priyal is a resident in good standing in our program; her expected dates of attendance are July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2020. I have worked with Priyal throughout her residency as staff and as the Radiology Residency Program Director. My comments are based own my personal observations as well as a review of Priyal's residency portfolio. One faculty evaluation summed up Priyal's progression through residency very accurately, She is on track to become a great radiologist! She has not one strength, but many. Clinically, Priyal has a very good knowledge base which she continually builds upon through practice and reading. She is very thoughtful in her approach to exams, carefully evaluating imaging, and developing appropriate search patterns. When considering protocols, she is not afraid to ask questions to enhance her understanding, and she utilizes constructive criticism to improve performance. Priyal's interpretations are accurate and she generates good quality, organized, efficient reports. In fact, efficiency is one of her marked characteristics. Without sacrificing accuracy, Priyal was functioning at a third year level during some second year rotations. The combination of efficiency and good humor, helps her handle stressful workloads and serves as an excellent example to more junior residents on service. As a consultant, she demonstrates professionalism and politeness in person or on the phone, easily explaining answers to imaging questions posed by clinical colleagues. Many evaluations note her laudable interpersonal communication skills, as well as work ethic which is characterized by a sincere desire for self-improvement.

I have known Priyal since she started her residency in 2016. My comments below are based on my own personal observations. Breast Imaging at Cleveland Clinic is a subspecialty practice with radiologists covering multiple sites. We have the opportunity to work closely with the residents when covering Main Campus. Although Priyal has only had one breast imaging rotation, I've had the pleasure of working with her a few, memorable times. She is an engaged learner participating in the reading room and taking diagnostic cases. She carefully reviews each case and makes an assessment. She eager to partake in all cases including ultrasound, MRI, and biopsies. In fact, in order to prepare for her first day on procedures, Priyal honed her ultrasound biopsy skills practicing on a phantom. In addition to her enthusiasm for breast imaging, Priyal has a good bedside manner. She is able to put patients as ease and explain procedures. On a personal level, Priyal is a kind person. The technologists enjoy working with her and she is a pleasure to teach. If Priyal chose to stay at Cleveland Clinic, we would be happy to have her in our fellowship. Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions. Sincerely

I have worked directly with AJ for three years and have observed him in several roles. In both Neuro Interventional and General Body Interventional Labs, AJ is attentive and prepared. He reviews cases in advance and is eager to participate. His questions and willingness to search out answers demonstrated to me his dedication to patient care on several occasions. While interacting with patients, I observed compassion that brought calm to nervous patients. He will excel with the procedural aspects of neuroradiology training. At the workstation AJ is known for his good eye, resourcefulness and hard work. He is friendly and quick to offer assistance to more junior learners. He supports his classmates and makes the residency stronger with his excellent attitude. I am confident he will be a future Radiology leader. His past academic and research accomplishments as an undergraduate and in medical school continued in residency. He is well suited to contribute to research in fellowship as well. Alex Hall, MD will no doubt excel in neuroradiology fellowship and quickly become a valued part of your team; I recommend him highly and ask that you carefully consider his application
